This is a project that I created for myself to help me understand two things:

1) How to create a functional database using python's Shelve module.

2) How to use git to push files from my computer to github.

Because my main goal is to learn the above points, this repository is a little messy.

Side note: I just realized that some of these files are too big to be displayed on 
           github. If you have any questions, contact me. 
           
Side note2: The data that I used can be found at(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Other/NYC-OpenData-Catalog/tdsx-cvye).
